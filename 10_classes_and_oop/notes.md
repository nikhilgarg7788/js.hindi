## why use OOP

## parts of OOP
Object literal 

- Constructor function
whenever we use NEW keyword then there is an empty object created and it is called an instance.
1. it gives a new instance evertime it is used
2. a constructor function call is there due to new keyword
in this all the arguments are packed inside and given to us
3. all the arguments are injected inside the THIS keyword
4. in this step we get all of them inside the function

- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)
