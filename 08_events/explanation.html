------------------default javascript----------------

javascript is synchronous 
step by step codes will execute or we can say in an order codes will execute
and a single threaded language





------------execution context in this----------------

in this an one line code is executed at a time
each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing





--------------blocking code vs non blocking code------
-blocking code blocks the flow of program
read file synchronously

-non blocking code  does not blocks the execution
read file asynchronously
